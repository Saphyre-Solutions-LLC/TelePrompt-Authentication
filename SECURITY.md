## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Development Security Guidelines

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Always validate user permissions before executing operations
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
   - Implement proper session management
   - Never store passwords in plain text

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization
   - Follow principle of least privilege

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
   - Use dependency pinning for production deployments

4. **Configuration Security**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Implement proper secret rotation policies

5. **Code Review Requirements**
   - All security-related changes require thorough review
   - Security team approval required for authentication changes
   - Automated security testing must pass before merge

### Secure Development Lifecycle

1. **Design Phase**
   - Conduct threat modeling for new features
   - Review security implications of architectural changes

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Follow secure coding standards
   - Use static analysis security testing (SAST)
   - Implement unit tests for security controls

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Perform dynamic application security testing (DAST)
   - Conduct penetration testing for major releases
   - Validate security controls work as intended

4. **Deployment Phase**
   - Use secure deployment pipelines
   - Implement infrastructure security controls
   - Monitor for security events

## Security Features

### Current Security Implementations

- **Authentication Framework**: ASP.NET Core Identity with proper password policies
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Encryption**: TLS 1.2+ for data in transit
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeouts
- **Redis Security**: Connection string encryption and access controls
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning via GitHub Dependabot
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis via CodeQL
- **Environment Isolation**: Proper separation of development, staging, and production

### Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-XSS-Protection

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence for investigation
   - Notify security team immediately

2. **Assessment**
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify root cause
   - Document timeline of events

3. **Containment**
   - Implement temporary fixes
   - Block malicious activity
   - Monitor for continued threats

4. **Recovery**
   - Deploy permanent fixes
   - Restore normal operations
   - Update security controls

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update security policies
   - Improve detection capabilities
